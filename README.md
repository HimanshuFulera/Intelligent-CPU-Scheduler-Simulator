#Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

Overview
The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a visualization tool for CPU scheduling algorithms, including:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling

This simulator allows users to input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority, then visualizes the execution order using Gantt charts. It also computes and displays key performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.

Features
âœ… Supports Multiple Scheduling Algorithms â€“ Compare different CPU scheduling techniques.
âœ… Real-Time Visualization â€“ View process execution dynamically through Gantt charts.
âœ… Performance Metrics â€“ Analyze average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ Easily input process details and modify parameters.

Usage
Enter process details (arrival time, burst time, priority).

Choose a scheduling algorithm.

Visualize the Gantt chart and check computed performance metrics.

Future Enhancements
Support for preemptive scheduling (e.g., Preemptive SJF, Priority Scheduling).

Additional performance analysis tools.

Export results as reports.
